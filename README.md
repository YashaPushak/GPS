# GPS

Golden Parameter Search (GPS) is an automated algorithm congifuration 
procedure. That is, it seeks to optimize the performance (in terms of
running time) of a target algorithm on a set of instances by automatically
finding high-quality values for the parameters of the target algorithm.

GPS is the first automated algorithm configuration procedure to exploit
recent insights into the structural properties of algorithm configuration
landscapes [Pushak & Hoos, 2018]. In particular, GPS assumes that each
parameter of the target algoritm effects a uni-modal response in the 
performance of the algorithm, when modified individually. Furthermore,
GPS assumes that most parameters of the target algorithm do not strongly
interact, thereby allowing GPS to optimize each parameter semi-independetly
in parallel. These two assumptions allow GPS to quickly and efficiently explore
the parameter configuration space. However, if you have reason to believe that
your particular target algorithm contains parameters that strongly violates
either of these two assumptions, then GPS may not be the appropriate 
configurator for your application. 

## Installing GPS

 - Create a python2.7 virtual environment
 - Download the latest version of the parameter configuration space parser
from https://github.com/YashaPushak/PCS 
 - While in the main PCS directory, install PCS with 
    pip install .
or
    python setup.py install --user
 - Download the latest version of GPS from https://github.com/YashaPushak/GPS
 - While in the main GPS directory, install GPS's other required python 
packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
 - Setup a redis database

## Using GPS

GPS is implemented in python2.7, but is designed to be used from the command
line. To use GPS you will need to launch a master process and one or more
worker processes. The master process will loop through each parameter, check
for newly completely target algorithm runs and queue new target algorithm
runs to be performed. The worker processes will repeatedly check for new
target algorithms, perform them and then save the reuslts. Communication 
between the master and worker processes is done through a redis database.
