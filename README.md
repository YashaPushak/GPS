# GPS
The Golden Parameter Search Configurator

This is copy of GPS and the related files taken from my PSM directory on 2019-03-05. The version of GPS in the PSM directory is a prototype that does not support categorical parameters. The plan for this copy is to extend it to handle categorical parameters as well as numerical ones and make it into a fully functional configurator.
